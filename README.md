# DoomEngine
Doom Engine made in java, loads from original wad file.
I made a simple version of doom in java a few days ago, I only got up to making simple raytracing to render and walk around a map array. I found a project made by a leonardo-ono of a Wolfenstein 3D game engine in java that uses the original game files to load the game.

So I decided to work on a similar project, A Doom engine in java that runs from the original wad file.
